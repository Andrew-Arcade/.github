### About Andrew Arcade

Andrew Arcade is a custom game console built with a Raspberry Pi 5 running Linux. Its main purpose is to play Unity games that I have created.

Since the Raspberry Pi 5 uses an ARM processor, Unity games can't be compiled to run on it directly. To solve this, we use a tool called Box64, which lets us run Unity games and apps on the Raspberry Pi by emulating the required architecture.

### Version 2

Version 2 of Andrew Arcade will feature a redesigned case. My goal is to make it more comfortable to use and to improve some of the mounting parts that didnâ€™t work well in the first version.

I basically finished building version 2, I am working on organizing all the repos and making instructions for everything.
